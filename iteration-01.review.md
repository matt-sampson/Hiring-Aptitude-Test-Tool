#Acuity Challenge
## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 25 2016
 * Where: At the Bahen Center


#Decisions turned out well:


Using Slack for discussions was a good decision since it many of us lived far apart so meeting in person was difficult. 
This also lets us discuss parts of the project with each other easily in case there was something that needed clarification.  
(This was decided in the planning meetings notes on the git.)

Another decision that has worked well is using googledocs. This has been really helpful for us in md files for the first 
deliverable as it allows all of us to look over the document and make any necessary changes. This is more convenient than 
using git to do this since we do not need to keep pulling or pushing changes and we do not have to deal with conflicts.



#Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:


One of our plans originally was to include some sort of a leaderboard into our program. In hindsight, 
this feature does not seem to important, especially when we take into account our use cases (which can be 
found on the git). So we should probably put away this feature for now and add it in if we have time.

Another decision that has not went very well is our decision to have weekly meetings. We had originally planned 
to have meetings every Tuesday at 5PM in person at the Bahen Center (this was on the planning meeting notes text 
file on git). But a lot of the times we have had members who could not make it to meetings because they were busy. 
As a result, we had a lot of meetings where we were missing a few people. But we kept the other members up-to-date 
through slack.



#We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

Since there were problems with setting up meetings at our desired time, we plan to discuss having a new meeting time. 
Otherwise, if everyone feels that they will no longer have issues making it to meetings, we will continue with what we planned.



## Product - Review

#Goals/tasks that were met/completed:


The main goal for us this deliverable was to plan our product so that we would have an idea of what we are building. 
The planning meeting notes and the user stories details what we want our program to be able to do.
The CRC cards for most of our backend have been completed (crc.pdf on the github).



#Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We originally planned to create a basic GUI to get an idea of how the program would look and implement javascript for
asking random multiplication questions. However, due to team members being busy, this could not be accomplished.



#Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

In the next iteration, we will begin the actual coding of our program. We want to be able to get the begin 
implementing the parts of the backend that our CRC cards describe.
We will also begin implementing more of the GUI.
We may need to create more CRC cards as we may be missing some features with what we currently have.
