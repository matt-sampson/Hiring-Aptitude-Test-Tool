Planning Meeting Notes:
The meeting was on Tuesday October 11 2016

We discussed the specifics of our program:
- This is a program that asks basic questions that could be mathematical or coding related
- It will keep track of how long it takes the user to answer questions and has a leaderboard that keeps track of the best scores
- Scoring can be based on the number of correct answers and time
- This program will let users email quizzes to others in order to challenge them
- The main target audience are job interviewers
    - Job interviewers can send job applicants quizzes in order to weed out people who are incompetent
    - This can save them, and the job applicant a lot of time

As a first phase we plan to implement:
- Simple multiplication questions
- Score, timing, leaderboards

Later on we can add features such as:
- A GUI for users
- More variety in questions
- The ability to email others challenges

For the first week we have laid out tasks for each member. There are 5 tasks and each member will be responsible for one:
1. Write up the product.md
2. Write up the iteration-01.plan.md
3. Write up the iteration-01.review.md
4. Implement random multiplication questions with java script
5. Implement basic GUI

We plan to communicate with eachother through Slack and/or Whatsapp.

We will work together to come up with answers for the first 3 tasks and then have a specific person
do the write up of it to hand in.
