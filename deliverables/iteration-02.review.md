# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tuesday November 15
 * Where: Bahen Center

Decisions turned out well:

 * List a few (2-5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * Support your argument (that a decisions was successful) by referring/linking to process artifact(s).
 
  Our original intention was to use java to create this project 
  https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/blob/master/deliverables/crc.pdf
  but we decided to switch to javascript since that would be better for creating a webapp. 
  The switch over to javascript has been working well for us.
  
  We decided to start off with just having simple multiple choice questions since these are the
  simplest to implement and it would allow us to focus on getting the rest of the program working
  so that we can worry about implementing more types of questions later.

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.
 
 As mentioned before, we originally decided to create our application with java, but this did not turn
 out well. https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/blob/master/deliverables/crc.pdf
 
 Although our decision to switch over to javascript is working well for implementing our application, it is
 a bit more difficult for some team members since not everyone knows how to write javascript so there's some
 difficulty with learning. https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/tree/master/website

 
## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.

 We have met the goal of generating multiple choice questions for our app.
 https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/blob/master/website/javascript/script.js
 
 We have met the goal of emailing quizzes to others and receiving results from the quizzes.
 https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/blob/master/website/server.js
 
 We have met the goal of creating a simple GUI.
 https://github.com/csc301-fall-2016/project-team-10/tree/master/website
 
Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

   We have implemented everything that we planned for this deliverable.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.
 
 We plan to have the ability to create quizzes with more types of questions instead of just multiple choice
 questions.
 
 We plan to improve the GUI to make it look more presentable.
 
 We plan to implement a leaderboard.
 
 There are also a few bugs that we need to fix (These are on our git issues)
