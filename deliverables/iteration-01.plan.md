# Acuity Challenge

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 2016
 * End date: October 25, 2016

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We will all work on team deliverable, such as planning and reviewing. 
Two of us will do the backend of our product, other three will do the frontend. 
We will help others if someone come across problems.

#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:

 * Meeting 1: (October 11st, 2016; in-person; on campus) discuss more details of our product; 
              split jobs to every team member for team deliverable 1.

 * Meeting 2: (October 18th, 2016; in-person; on campus) team members are going to share current stage of their jobs; 
              making sure everyone is on the same page; indicate problems team members came across when they are working on their jobs.


 * Meeting 3: (October 25th, 2016; in-person; on campus) review team deliverable 1; review every memberâ€™s job status.


(In addition to these meetings, team members will communicate with each other by using instant message app)


#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.       

We will build our product from simple to complex and fancy. Every week, we will assign tasks that will need to 
be completed by team members. We will have meeting almost every week to check if everyone has finished their assigned 
task. We will then discuss what needs to be done next and assign more work. We will keep track of who is working on 
what every week with a textfile that will be put on git.

## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Implement the basic GUI of product.(A few buttons, score, and time)
 * Using JavaScript to implement random multiplication questions.
 * Create CRC cards

Artifacts

A simple website which will generate simple multiplication questions, but not publicly accessible yet. At this stage, the 
website generates 20 random multiplication questions. It has answer box beside each question and a submit button, which will 
give the final score and time to user. 
We will also write up a couple of use cases so that we will have a general idea of what features we should include in our program.
CRC cards will also be made so that we will know what needs to be implemented during the next phase when we actually begin coding.
