# Acuity Challenge

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 11, 2016
 * End date: October 25, 2016

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We have split the work up so that one person will work on the
frontend, one person will work on the backend and the third will work
on writing the deliverables and do some of the backend. We have trouble
communicating with the other two members

#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:

 * Meeting 1: (November 11st, 2016; in-person; on campus) We discussed what we wanted to 
              accomplish  for this deliverable and who will be doing what.

 * Meeting 2: (November 8th, 2016; online) A quick update meeting online to see what has
              been done so far.


#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.       

We do not have many artifacts to do this other than simple meeting notes to describe what needs to be done. The meeting
notes are kept on a googledrive which team members have access to since the link is posted on slack. They will be uploaded
to git later for the deliverable.

## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Implement the GUI of our webapp
 * Using JavaScript create quizzes of multiple choice questions
 * Have the ability to email links to quizzes to others

Artifacts

For this iteration, we plan to build a webapp that is capable of generating multiple choice multiplication questions.
Users should be able to select answers to questions and check if their answer is correct. We will also implement
the ability for users to create quizzes and email them to others. Lastly we will implement a simple GUI for the above
to be possible.
