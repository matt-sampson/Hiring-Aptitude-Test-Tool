# Acuity Challenge

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

The product will be a website that hosts a varying selection of games or challenges designed to test a personâ€™s acuity. The nature of these challenges will be to ask the user a series of questions, such as math or logic, and record their answer and response time. This is designed to be a formal and streamlined way for users to demonstrate their capabilities as a part of the initial job interview or screening process. 

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target users are primarily recruiters or others in charge of the job screening process. Before investing time and money into a candidate, the first step is to assess their basic qualifications and abilities. They can quickly and easily design a test and send it to candidates for testing and review their results in detail. If a candidate passes, then more time and money may be invested into investigating if they are fit for the job or internship positions. Otherwise, the time investment for an unsuitable candidate can be minimized.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Currently, the initial screening process will usually incorporate simple acuity tests in the phone interview. However, this is not ideal as it already requires significant time investment from the interviewer, and results are less detailed than a formally written and timed test. The product solves both of these problems by allowing the interviewer to instead design one test and send it to multiple candidates, and view written and timed results. This saves them time and effort compared to multiple one on one phone calls. 

The first major design decision made was to make this product website based. Although phone apps may be more convenient, we believe people will prefer to use a computer due to the larger screen being easier to read and the ability to type on a keyboard, resulting in faster text input. Furthermore, we decided to allow recruiters to send challenges through email, since all job candidates are likely to have provided that form of contact information and will be accustomed to communication in this manner. Even if they have not done tests using our products in the past, they will simply have to click on a link contained within the email to begin. Their test results would be processed by the website and automatically sent back to the recruiter, which can then view and store the results as needed.
