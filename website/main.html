                <p id="desc">Acuity Tester is a website designed to help automate the interview process. 
                Interviewers are able to create simple quizzes which serve as a way to filter out
                applicants who are unlikely to make it to the later stages of the interview process. Acuity
                Tester works great for small teams or startups that may not have the time and/or resources
                necessary to interview every applicant, or are unable to obtain licensing for
                a similar proprietary product.</p>
                
                <p id="desc"> Acuity Tester is not just for those looking for a few helpings hands. Here, prospectful applicants
                can come to practice for interviews using some of our hand-crafted quizzes. Afterwards, they can see
                how they rank up against other applicants who have taken the same quiz and figure out which skills
                they need to improve on to be competitive in the market.</p>
